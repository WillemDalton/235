                &emsp;Hi, I'm Willem Dalton, a 2nd Year undergraduate student at RIT studying Game Development and Design. 
                I am interested in computing and programming, but I also enjoy drawing, 3D modeling, and other activities.
                Some things I do in my free time are working on personal projects, going to the gym, and hanging out with friends. 
                Although I already know a bit about HTML/CSS/JS, I hope to gain a more solid understanding on some of the practices used in web development. 
                When I graduate, I want to work in Software Development or Software Engineering!
            </p>
