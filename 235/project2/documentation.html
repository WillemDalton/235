<h1>NASA PICTURE GENERATOR DOCUMENTATION</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
    My process and design choices for this website were all based off of my API choice. 
    I chose to use NASA's APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API because I have always been fascinated by space, and it seemed like a perfect pick for this project.
    The documentation for it was easy to understand, and the API is quick an easy to use. A lot of my design choices were based off this,
    And I really wanted to hit the "spacey" theme. I feel that I did a good job on my website. The Programming process was also very easy,
    there's nothing to unique about my code nor any obstacles I found too difficult to overcome.

<h2>Requirements/Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>
    I feel that I hit all the requirements for a satisfactory project. 
    My Project contains 3 controls, formats API JSON data in a pleasing way, and also handles errors pretty well.
    There are a lot of things I could have done to bring the website "one step higher." I was thinking about 
    loading a quick API call before the user loaded and floating images of space in the background, but I chose not to.
    Another decision I made was choosing not to save controls in local storage. I know we were supposed to, but I found it to be 
    more annoying than anything for the user.

    <em>Overall, I believe my project deserves an A. I meet all requirements and feel I excel in some.</em>
