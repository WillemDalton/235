    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>
        In <i>My Garden</i>, the user tends to a zen garden in which they can till and draw on with their mouse. 
        Users can also place rocks, trees, and other objects throughout their garden to decorate it and make it their own.

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
        For my game, there's really no overarching story. I just want the player to "feel" a certain mood. 
        I want the player to be relaxed, and have fun. Creating a Zen Garden is about peace of mind and I really want users to experience that.
        The only accomplishment for the player is to make a fun garden.

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>
        I want my game to look pretty professional, so I'm not going to go for a pixel style that I normally would. 
        I want it to look sleek and minimalist, because I think the focus should be less on the site.
        I plan to put audio in the background as well, that the player can turn off.

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        The player's only control will be the mouse. 
        I think I may also make it so they can use arrows keys to rotate around the top down view, but I'm not sure.
