    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>
        In <i>My Garden</i>, the user tends to a zen garden in which they can till and draw on with their mouse. 
        Users can also place rocks, trees, and other objects throughout their garden to decorate it and make it their own.

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
        For my game, there's no overarching story. I just want the player to feel relazed.
        The only accomplishment for the player is to make a fun garden game.

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>
        My game's aesthetic is a bit tropical but very toned back. Theres a repeating leaf tile pattern for the background,
         and buttons represented as wooden panels.

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        The player's only control is the mouse, and q/e to change brush size, z to undo.

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>Throughout the development of the game, my goals and scope changed quite a lot. Once I finished the main drawing mechanic and after critiques, 
        I found that people most enjoyed the drawing. So instead of going with my original plan, I decided to scale back on the "zen garden" 
        portion and focus on debugging drawing to make it  a better experience. Realistically, people don't care about drawing around things, they just want to draw!</p>
