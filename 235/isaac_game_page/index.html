    <h1 id="image_top">&emsp; What is the Binding of Isaac?</h1>

    <p> &emsp;The Binding of Isaac is an almost top-down game that borrows heavily from the roguelike genre. <br>
        Players explore dungeons that consist of a series of connected, single-screen rooms with randomized environments,   
        items and enemies for each gameplay session. <br>
        Like the original games death is final and the player has to restart the entire game to continue.

    <blockquote>
        “Isaac, naked and unarmed, defends himself by spraying his aggressors with his own salty tears. 
        It’s impossible to play The Binding Of Isaac without coming away with the feeling that McMillen could really use a hug.”
