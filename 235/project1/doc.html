    <h2>Sources</h2>
    <p>I used a few sources for my final site, primarily:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://elements.envato.com/">Envato</a> for the website template</li>
        <li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noticia+Text">Google Fonts</a> for use of their font "Noticia"</li>
        <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> for general assistance on css</li>
        <li>Holy Grail Demo for assistance in setting up media queries and grids</li>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>For my general goal of the site, I made a website on the process of creating a 3D model (modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, rendering). <br>
    I think it's a really interesting subject, as I've been 3D modeling for a few years, and I think it was deserving of a small site.<br>
    It's also a simple enough subject such that final product the site only spans one page.</p>
    <p>This goal helped me locate a design that I found interesting and difficult enough to create a website with. <br>
    I chose my design because it was easy and seemed very fun. It allows me to create notes and comments next to a large hero image that spans the entire site. <br>
    The user is constantly looking at an image as they scroll through the site.</p>

    <p>I don't really have any notes for this project so far. I thought my CSS and HTML was pretty solid, though there is always room for improvement. <br>
    I cleaned up my existing CSS and HTML from the previous phase, making it cleaner and more readable.<br>
    One spot I thought I went above and beyond on was creating the arrow next to the "evolution" header. I thought the solution I found was really smart.</p>
