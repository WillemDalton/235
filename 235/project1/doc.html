    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>For my general goal of the site, I want to make a website on the process of creating a 3D model (modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, rendering). <br>
    I think it's a really interesting subject, as I've been 3D modeling for a few years, and I think it could be deserving of a website. <br>
    It's also a simple enough subject such that the site only spans one page.</p>
    <p>This goal helped me locate a design that I found interesting and difficult enough to create a website with. <br>
    I chose my design because it was easy and seemed very fun. It allows me to create notes and comments next to a large hero image that spans the entire site. <br>
    The user is constantly looking at an image as they scroll through the site.</p>

    <p>I don't really have any notes for this project so far. I thought my CSS and HTML was pretty solid, though there is always room for improvement. <br>
    There were some spots where I used some cheap and dirty solutions as I couldn't think of a better one, but the desktop version looks really good. <br>
    One spot I thought I went above and beyond on was creating the arrow next to the "evolution" header. I thought the solution I found was really smart.</p>
