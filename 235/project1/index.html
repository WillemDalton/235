            <p class="medium">reating a 3D model is a difficult and unique process. It is unlike any other form of art&mdash;except maybe sculpting. Creating digital art in a 3D environment on a 2D laptop screen creates many difficulties, but the final result is so rewarding. In this site, I will be going over the process of creating a 3D model and explain why 3D modeling holds such a special place in my heart.</p>
            <p class="medium">I have been modeling for roughly 5 years now. I first started 3D modeling to create assets for some personal projects I was working on in highschool. Looking back at it, it's a bit of a funny reason to start, though it created a lifelong passion for a new artform I had never known existed before.</p>
            <p class="medium">You might be asking: <span class="italic">"Why is 3D modeling important? Why would anyone do it?"</span>and to answer that question, there are many reasons why it is important! It's used in Film, TV, modeling and simulations, Video Games, Advertising, and much more! We can also convert our 3D models into the real world with things such as 3D printing. It's also a unique way of expressing our imagination that is more visible than other art forms.</p>
