            <p class="medium"><span id="dropcap" class="home bold">C</span>reating a 3D model is a difficult and unique process. It is unlike any other form of art&mdash;except maybe sculpting. Creating digital art in a 3D environment on a 2D laptop screen creates many difficulties, but the final result is so rewarding. In this site, I will be going over the process of creating a 3D model and explain why 3D modeling holds such a special place in my heart.</p>
            <p class="medium">I have been modeling for roughly 5 years now. I first started 3D modeling to create assets for some personal projects I was working on in highschool. Looking back at it, it's a bit of a funny reason to start, though it created a lifelong passion for a new artform I had never known existed before.</p>
            <p class="medium">You might be asking: <span class="italic">"Why is 3D modeling important? Why would anyone do it?"</span>and to answer that question, there are many reasons why it is important! It's used in Film, TV, modeling and simulations, Video Games, Advertising, and much more! We can also convert our 3D models into the real world with things such as 3D printing. It's also a unique way of expressing our imagination that is more visible than other art forms.</p>
            <p class="medium">Now that I've given you  the overview of 3D asset production, I'm going to dive into the first part of the process, Modeling.</p>

            <p class="medium"><span id="dropcap" class="home bold">C</span>reating something in 3D always starts with choosing some software to work in. My personal favorite software to use is Blender, but Maya is also a fantastic choice. These softwares may be hard to use at first, but it gets easier.</p>
            <p class="medium">When you open your software of choice, you should open up into what is called a scene. This is the area where all of your modeling work will get done. Models are made of faces, edges and vertices. Vertices are zero dimensional points in your scene. Connections between these vertices make edges. Connections of edges make faces.</p>
            <p class="medium">There are a few basics of modeling, and their uses are extensive and convoluted, so I will only go over them briefly. The first is extrude, which allows you to extend a given face outwards or even inwards. Next is inset faces, which essentially allows you to copy a face and move it inwards so that you have more geometry. You can also bevel faces or edges, which allows you to smooth edges.</p>

            <p class="medium"><span id="dropcap" class="home bold">T</span>he next step of making a good model is unwrapping your model. Because we don't <span class="italic">really</span> want all of our models to be gray, untextured, and boring, we want to do something called UV unwrapping.</p>
            <p class="medium">We can't texture a 3D object using a 2D canvas normally, so we have to cut and tear the model so that we can unwrap and flatten it to paint it.</p>
            <p class="medium">We're given a few good tools to use to make unwrapping easy, "cutting" and "seaming." cut allows us to place a cut on the edge of a model. If the cuts form a loop around the model, the model is split into two things called UV shells. UV shells are awesome for us because we can move them around and flatten them to texture.</p>

            <p class="medium">Finally, the last section of our brief modeling adventure is texturing. Texturing is a crucial part of asset production, as great texturing often hides low poly modeling. I use substance painter to create my textures, but I'm sure there's other cheaper software available.</p>
