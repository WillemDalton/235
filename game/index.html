        Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. <br>
        Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. <br>
        The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]
